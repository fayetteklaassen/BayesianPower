# BayesianPower

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of BayesianPower is to determine the required sample size or
the unconditional and conditional error probabilities when a hypothesis
that imposes inequality constraints between group means is compared with
its complement, another inequality constraint hypothesis or the
unconstrained hypothesis. [Klaassen, Hoijtink & Gu
(unpublished)](10.17605/OSF.IO/D9EAJ) describe four methods of weighing
unconditional or conditional error probabilities to determine the sample
size. Reversely, the same rules can be applied to determine the power of
a study.

## Installation

You can install the released version of BayesianPower from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("BayesianPower")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("fayetteklaassen/BayesianPower")
```

## Vignette

There is a vignette available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/fayetteklaassen/BayesianPower/blob/master/vignettes/bayesianpower.Rmd)
that contains a description of the functionality of the package and some
examples.
