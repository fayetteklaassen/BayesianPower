Title: Sample Size and Power for Comparing Inequality Constrained Hypotheses
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Fayette Klaassen
Maintainer: Fayette Klaassen <klaassen.fayette@gmail.com>
Description: A collection of methods to determine the required sample size for
    the evaluation of inequality constrained hypotheses by means of a Bayes 
    factor. Alternatively, for a given sample size, the unconditional error 
    probabilities or the expected conditional error probabilities can be
    determined.
